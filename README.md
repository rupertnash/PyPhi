# PyPhi
## Python for Scientific Computing on Intel's Xeon Phi MIC Platform

This repository contains tools for cross-compiling a Python interpreter
and the Numpy and Scipy libraries for an Intel Xeon Phi 
Many Integrated Core (MIC) coprocessor,
allowing you to run Python code using those libraries as parallel native
executables on the coprocessor, communicating and processing
with the full power and expressivity of Python.

Based on [Emilio Castillo Villar's work](http://software.intel.com/en-us/forums/topic/392736)
to cross-compile Python.

Numpy was never designed to be cross-compiled for anything, much less
a system without a compiler of its own, so much effort was placed into
re-engineering it to use the "MIC" architecture and the relevant Intel MKL
libraries. Internal testing code for Numpy and Scipy also works.

After downloading the Makefile into a folder and running `make`
like the following:

	mkdir mic
	cd mic
	wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rupertnash/PyPhi/master/Makefile && make

or

	git clone https://github.com/rupertnash/PyPhi.git mic
	cd mic
	make

that folder `mic` will then contain `python/_install`, which will be the
`$PYTHONHOME` whose `bin/python` can be executed on the Phi, and whose
`lib/python2.7[/site-packages]` should be on `$PYTHONPATH`.
See `mic_task.sh` for a usage example.

Tested on the Babbage cluster at NERSC as part of the
[MANTISSA project](https://www.nersc.gov/assets/HPC-Requirements-for-Science/ASCR2017/Prabhat-Quincey.pdf).

## REQUIREMENTS

- 64-bit Intel system for compiling.

- Recent Python installed on that system;
  tested with the Anaconda distribution.

- Intel Composer XE - the path to the MKL libraries must be added in numpy/site.cfg

- A Xeon Phi coprocessor for testing (not needed for compilation itself.)

## TODO

- Currently, SSE instructions are disabled for Numpy, since they are
  very different on the Phi. This would require a native porting effort
  for such files as `einsum.c.src`.

- MPI such as mpi4py.

- Pip/setuptools for non-native python packages.

- A generic modified version of Pip for native python packages.
